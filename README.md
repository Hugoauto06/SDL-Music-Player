# SDL2 Music Player
A C++/SDL2 basic Music Player. This is a lot of spaghetti but it was a fun experiment :)

If you dont want to setup the project all you need to do is to go into "Debug" and run the only ".exe" file, it should work without any issue. All you need to do is to put all the ".mp3" files into the "Music" folder and there should be no issue

It's pretty simple and easy to undestand (expet for rendering text maybe), i had some issues rendering text (as you might see on the code) and that's the main reason. Its finished but could be optimized and add a couple of new features, but this was just my attemp to make a working SDL2 application and learn about Vectors/Unordered_maps.

<h2>How To Use:</h2>
Just go into the "Music" folder and place all ".mp3" files there, the app should detect them (if already open, restart)

<h2>Dependencies:</h2>
SDL2<p></p>
SDL2_image<p></p>
SDL2_Mix<p></p>
Dirent.h<p></p>

Its not the best looking app, but it gets the job done lol
