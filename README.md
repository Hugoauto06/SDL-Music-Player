# SDL2 Build
C++ + SDL2 Basic Music Player

This is a lot of spaghetti code and kind of a mess.

If you dont want to setup the project all you need to do is to go into "Debug/" and run the only ".exe" file, it should work without any issue. All you need to do is to put all the ".mp3" files into the "Music/" folder and there should be no issue

<h2>How To Use:</h2>
Just go into the "Music/" folder and place all ".mp3" files there, the app should detect them (if already open, restart)

<h2>Dependencies:</h2>
SDL2<p></p>
SDL2_image<p></p>
SDL2_Mix<p></p>
Dirent.h<p></p>
