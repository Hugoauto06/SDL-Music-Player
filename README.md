# SDL2 Build
C++ + SDL2 Basic Music Player

This is a lot of spaghetti code and kind of a mess.

If you dont want to setup the project all you need to do is to go into "Debug/" and run the only ".exe" file, it should work without any issue. All you need to do is to put all the ".mp3" files into the "Music/" folder and there should be no issue

Dependencies:
SDL2
SDL2_image
SDL2_Mix
Dirent.h
